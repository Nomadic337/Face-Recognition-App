# Face-Recognition-App
Web app inspired by Facebook's face recognition software. This is the frontend component of the app, which is build with React. 

A user can sign up or sign in, and add the link/path of an image to the "image search component". If the image contains a person's face, the Clarifai API helps identify it 
and a blue square box will encompass it.

(Next: It can only identify one face right now. Why not several?)
